# Crime-Analysis-using-Clustering-Method
The crime rate is tend to be increasing now-a-days. The objective of this project is to analyse the crime took place in the past. 

Analysing the type of crimes help us to understand the reason for the crime to happen. 

And also it will be useful for understanding various dimensions of crime, like city which has higher number of thefts. 

The objective is to determine the crime type whether it is unique or frequently occurring. And to determine the number of crimes happened at a particular day.

The crime analysis is carried out using the cluster method.Cluster analysis is the task of grouping a set of observations or objects in such a way that they share a common characteristics. Each group is called as a cluster.

The clusters are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. Clustering technique is used to group the different crimes happen at a particular city.

And the number of crimes happen at a particular day and so on. 

Such clustering technique allow us to summarize the overall data and gives a clear idea to understand the reasons behind crime.
